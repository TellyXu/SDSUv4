Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality for adults over 50 years, regardless of gender. Localized, or early-stage lung cancer, can be treated aggressively and result in better outcomes and better overall survival, compared to lung cancer detected at a later stage when it has likely migrated beyond the primary tumor and treatment options are more limited. Routine screening for lung cancer via low-dose computed tomography supports early detection however it is not systematically utilized resulting in missed opportunities for early detection. Efforts to develop models for identifying and diagnosing lung cancer using AI/ML from screening data have been in development for over a decade, however, they fail to consider important context including: social determinants of health (SDOH) factors such as geography, environment, social, and similar which are critical to identify candidates whom, due to a lack of routine screening, were diagnosed at later stages. This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to identify multi-level factors associated with detection of late-stage lung-cancer especially in underserved populations. </p>"
